      <h1>CSS-BY-JS</h1>
      <span>The next step of CSS-in-JS.</span>
      <p>
        All of the CSS you see on this page started with a standard CSS file,
        which was then processed into an array of rules, and then passed into a
        JS function that applied it to the appropriate elements on the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Go ahead. Inspect the page. The only CSS file that's loaded is from
        Google Fonts.
      </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        It's real hot to do weird things to use CSS these days.
